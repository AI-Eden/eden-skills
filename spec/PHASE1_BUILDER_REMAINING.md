# PHASE1_BUILDER_REMAINING.md

Index of remaining Builder-owned work for Phase 1 CLI.
This file is intentionally short and points to detailed sources.

## Remaining Work Items

No unresolved Builder-owned Phase 1 tasks at this checkpoint.

## Notes

- Architect-owned tasks (taxonomy, rubric, crawler strategy RFC) are intentionally excluded.
- Historical completion details are tracked in `EXECUTION_TRACKER.md` (Section `6.1`).
- If new Builder-owned Phase 1 gaps are discovered, add a new Builder task ID and link it here.
